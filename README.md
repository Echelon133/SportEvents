# SportEvents Application

REST API for live text coverage of football matches. Each match has a separate websocket topic. Thus, it is possible to
read all past events of a certain match through a GET request and then to receive all future events live over a 
websocket connection.


Application features:

* OAuth2 authentication system (tokens provided by github)
* Validation of user-provided data
* CRUD operations on all resources (stadiums, teams, matches, leagues)
* Live listening to match events thanks to websockets

* type value must be exactly *GOAL*
* teamId value must be an Id of one of the teams that play in a match. Id of a team that does not exist or does not play in this match will be rejected

should be sent as a GoalEvent. 
This event increments teamA/teamB penalty counters that are separate from the regular score goal counters. 
This makes it possible to keep scores such as ex. "2:2 (3:1)"

* all fields are required
* time value must be between 1 and 120 (penalty shootouts are after the OT, so by default the client can send 120)
* type value must be exactly *PENALTY*

## Websockets

To be able to listen to match events over a STOMP endpoint, the client has to connect to **/sport-events**.
There is no need to authenticate when connecting to this endpoint. The application does not accept any messages sent in.
Every client can connect to this endpoint, regardless its origin (CORS set to allow all).

Example code of a client app, that uses SockJS and Stomp:
```JS
var socket = new SockJS("http://localhost:8080/sport-events");
var stompClient = Stomp.over(socket);

stompClient.connect({}, onConnection, onError);
``` 

When an event is added to a particular match, it is simultaneously sent over to a topic **/matches/{matchId}**, where
*matchId* is the ID of a specific match. 

Every match resource has a *websocketPath* field that contains full topic name where this match events will be accessible.

```JS
var websocketPath = matchJSON.websocketPath;
stompClient.subscribe(websocketPath, onMessageReceived);
```
